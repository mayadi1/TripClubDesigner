   All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors.
 All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits
 dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits
 are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish,
 use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as
 a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts
of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts
used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf)
might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches
the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those
scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken
from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its
original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite
code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
